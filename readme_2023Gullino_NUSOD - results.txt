Figures inserted in 2023Gullino_NUSOD are reproduced by launching the script: pris_DataGullino_NUSOD2023 (in the form of VENUS chart)
	- The workspaces are loaded from the folder "out"
	- Change the name in pris_DataGullino_NUSOD2023 to plot different results
	
The two workspaces are generated launching two scripts: 
	- Main_OX_JSTQE: for the pin VCSEL 
	- Main_1T_inf_ox: for the TJ-VCSEL with oxide below the TJ
both run in the parametric configuration to simulate all the four temperature at once.
