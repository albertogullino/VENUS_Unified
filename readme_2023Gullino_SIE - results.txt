SIE 2023 figures generation: 

- LIV and sheet carrier distribution:
	- Run "pris_SIE2023.m"
	- The load workspaces are stored in the folder "out"

- Load the same workspaces one at time (instead of store them in P, A, B structures)
  and run "quiverFast.m", contained in folder "PlotAndTests"
  
- The workspaces are generated by launching
	- "MAIN_OX_JSTQE.m", for the pin VCSEL simulation
	- "MAIN_1TJ_inf_ox.m", for the TJ-VCSELs (different "iStruttura" must be set)
		- iStruttura=25: for the A-TJ-VCSEL
		- iStruttura=26: for the B-TJ-VCSEL
